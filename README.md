# Equity & Learning Gaps Dashboard

This project was built during the **EECE490/690 Hackathon – "From Data to Impact"**.  
Our mission was to transform raw **National Student Assessment data (Grades 1–6)** into actionable insights that highlight **learning gaps, equity issues, and at-risk students**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Education policymakers and teachers often lack clear, visual insights into:
- Where students are underperforming
- Which groups (e.g., boys vs. girls) face inequities

This dashboard provides **actionable visual analytics** to help target interventions and allocate resources fairly.

Lebanon’s **National Student Assessment dataset** contains thousands of records across grades, subjects (Arabic, English, French, Math), and regions.  
However, raw Excel sheets are fragmented and difficult to analyze.

Our project aims to answer key questions:
- Which regions and subjects show the highest learning gaps?
- Where do equity concerns (e.g., gender differences) appear?
- Which students are most at risk of falling below proficiency?
- How can policymakers triage and prioritize interventions?

## 🛠️ Approach & Architecture

The project has four main parts:

1. **Data Processing**  
   - Cleaned and normalized raw Excel files (Grades 1–6).  
   - Handled noisy column names in Arabic, English, and French.  
   - Produced **tidy CSVs** with:
     - Region × Grade × Subject aggregates  
     - Gender gap analysis  
     - Domain-level breakdowns  

2. **Risk Modeling**  
   - Trained **logistic regression models** to estimate student risk of scoring below proficiency.  
   - Calibrated predictions with cross-validation.  
   - Exported:
     - `student_risk_scores.csv` → per-student probabilities  
     - `risk_model_metrics.json` → model metrics (AUC, Brier score, etc.)  
     - `risk_model_coefficients.csv` → feature importance  

3. **Clustering & Feature Exploration**  
   - Grouped students by performance patterns.  
   - Identified clusters of common weaknesses (e.g., reading comprehension vs writing).  

4. **Frontend Dashboard (Streamlit)**  
   - Interactive UI with pages:  
     - Overview  
     - Learning Gaps  
     - Equity  
     - Overlap  
     - Triage  
     - Clusters  
     - Students  
   - Visualizes results in an **easy-to-use equity dashboard**.  
   - Built with **Streamlit**, runs fully inside **Docker**.

## 🚀 Hackathon Impact

This project helps ministries & schools to:
- Identify struggling regions and grades  
- Pinpoint equity gaps by gender and domain  
- Prioritize targeted interventions for at-risk cohorts  


## To Run the dashboard: 
## Only Run Frontend Folder 
### 1. With Docker (recommended)
From inside the `frontend/` folder:
```bash
docker build -t equity-dashboard .
docker run --rm -p 8501:8501 equity-dashboard
```
## 2. Without Docker
```bash
cd frontend
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
